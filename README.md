## Building a Release for Linux

Before building a release for Linux, ensure you have set up your development environment for Linux desktop support. You can follow the instructions on the Flutter website [here](https://flutter.dev/desktop#linux).

Once your environment is set up, you can build a release using the following steps:

1. From the root of your project, run `flutter build linux`.
2. The release bundle will be created at `/build/linux/x64/release/bundle`.

To run your application, navigate to the release bundle directory and execute your app:

```sh
cd build/linux/x64/release/bundle
./your_app_name
```
